A case for the masses, larger battery sizes and multiple imu types. 

I know this is very empty right now, but I literally just uploaded this lol.

This case can work for batteries that are 60mm long, a larger size than arcturus, but a taller case due to this. 
I plan to make more imu trays, but for now its just bmi. I might make and upload a 6050 tray, but thats all for now.

Same components from arcturus, but larger battery.
